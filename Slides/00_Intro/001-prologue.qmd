## Motivation

Employers need to estimate what will happen to a market if/when prices, techonology, consumer tastes, or policies changes

. . .

[But other than finding a job, we can apply these concepts to our own lives]{.hii}

Consider your single most valuable resource: [Time]{.hi .big}

- As a students, you can spend it many different ways:

    - Studying and going to lectures
    - Exercising or completing a hobby
    - Socializing
    - Staring at the wall

. . .

They make choices on:

- Increasing marketing/advertising expenditures
